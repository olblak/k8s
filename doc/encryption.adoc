=== Encryption
We use gpg keys to encrypt/decrypt kubernetes secret +
In order to be able to automate this process we must define some rules. +

* We use one certificate per environment.
* All environment's certificates follow the same pattern
** Kind of key: 'RSA and RSA'
** Size: 4096
** Key validity: 0
** Real Name: <environment>-jenkinsinfra-k8s 
** Email: infra@lists.jenkins-ci.org
** Comment: GPG key use to encrypt <environment> secrets for k8s
* Public keys are exported in configurations/<environment>/public.key and published on git +
    ``gpg --export --armor <environment>-jenkinsinfra-k8s > ./resources/configurations/<environment>/public.key``
