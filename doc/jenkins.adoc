In order to run this project through Jenkins, we need to configure at least two following things.

* SSH access to kubernetes cluster (cfr deployment section)
** Add ssh credential with id 'staging-ssh-k8s' for staging 
** Add ssh credential with id 'production-ssh-k8s' for production 
* Private key to unencrypt secrets.
** Add private keys to jenkins node that run the project

At the moment Jenkinsfile is only configured to deploy on production or staging +
It may be interesting to use jenkins-infra/azure project to provision testing cluster

IMPORTANT: Environment defined by $ENV will be deploy on ${PREFIX}mgmt.${LOCATION}.cloudapp.azure.com.+
Defaults values are defined in k8s.default
